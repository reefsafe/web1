<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/infrastructure.html#encoding-terminology">aridina cantonensis, <strong>the <u>bee shrimp</u></strong>, is a species of small freshwater shrimp</a> in the family Atyidae. It is native to Taiwan.[1] These shrimp are scavengers, and eat small pieces of decayed vegetation and algae.[2] Bee shrimp have a life span of about 18 months. They enjoy a temperature in the 70 to 78 °F (21 to 26 °C) range.[3] Many modern versions of bee shrimp are selectively bred for their characteristics.[4]
Bee shrimp are in demand as aquarium pets. In Taiwan and other areas with suitable climates shrimp farms have sprung up to supply Bee shrimp,[5] although they are more difficult to farm than other shrimp because their health depends on being raised in soft water that matches the pH of their native streams.[6][2]
There are many variants of the bee shrimp:The black bee shrimp, sometimes called the Crystal Bee, is the most common variety. Some of the other varieties have been developed from it through selective breeding.[6]
The blue bee shrimp is a wild shrimp that is being harvested from streams in China to supply aquarium owners.[7]
The golden bee shrimp has a white shell and orangy gold flesh.

<p>The crystal red shrimp (called "red bee shrimp" in Japan) is a red and white variety specially bred for the aquarium hobby industry. In 1996 Hisayasu Suzuki of Japan discovered among his population of Black Bee shrimp a red one; and later two more. By selectively breeding these,[8] over time he and other shrimp breeders obtained shrimp with intense red and white stripes with various patterns, but with little genetic diversity.[2]
Shrimp breeders have given colourful names to the many other variants of the bee shrimp, which include the Princess Bee, Blue Bolt, Tangerine Tiger and Shadow Panda.[5]</p>
